# Basic_Node_Red
This is a repository where you can find some flows on node-red and we use some libraries from telegram. 

I want to add to this repository the libraries that have been used, 
for the creation of boots as well as the tutorials that have been used 
for the realization of the workshops with this software. 

So Firts i tell you the hardware I use is a Intel Edison
